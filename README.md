# Go Backend for Library App

### Compile and Run Server

```sh
go run main.go
```

I noticed that tests are failing when running in the terminal.  I have been running the tests purely in VSCode which is why I have noticed this issue.  When ran with VSCode with the proper dev tools, Tests are green.
